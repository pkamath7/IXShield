# IXShield
A prototype of smart glove built on ESP32

The project features
1. A custom designed PCB shield that snuggly fits onto an ESP32 DevKitC board
2. The PCB shield has a charging circuit for a lipo power source, a brushless DC motor for haptic feedback, a accelerometer for orientation and positional sensing
3. Firmware code to configure the I/O and functionality of the shield, developed on Arduino to enable open source collaborators
4. Sample applications such as Android Blaster which was built using Processing 2, which allows the user of the shield to use it as a joystick to control a rocket as it navigates through the astroid belt.
